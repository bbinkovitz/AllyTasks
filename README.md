"Women of today are still being called upon to stretch across the gap of male ignorance and to educate men as to our existence and our needs. This is an old and primary tool of all oppressors to keep the oppressed occupied with the masterâ€™s concerns."
~~ Audre Lorde

Tasks proposed by people from historically marginalized groups (by no means limited to the gender categories mentioned in the Audre Lorde quote above or gender at all for that matter), so our allies can see what we need from them and pick tasks they want to help with.

The repo doesn't contain anything but a license and this README. This repo exists mainly as a host for an issue queue. 

For an explanation of the "minion" terminology, please see:
http://www.collectqt.me/

In the sense that I am using it here, "minion" refers to anyone working in solidarity with someone whose axes of oppression differ from their own.

This repo exists to answer the oft-asked question, "what can I do, as member of [privileged group] do to help [members of oppressed group]".

GUIDELINES:
=====

1. Create tasks only on your own behalf ("your" can be plural here - including on the behalf of a group that you belong to.) Describe a task that, because of structural oppression affecting you, could be more effectively or easily accomplished with the help of someone with privilege on that axis. Or it could just be something you're tired of doing all the time that you want someone else to take on for a while. But please don't create tasks on behalf of a group you're not part of, and please don't create tasks for yourself to complete. 
2. When you take on a task, assign it to yourself. If you're interested in a task but need more clarification, put a question on the issue queue. Authors of tasks, be prepared to provide reasonable and necessary clarification to people who need info to work on your tasks.
3. Anyone can create a task as long as it adheres to the guidelines and the spirit of requesting solidarity and support. Tasks are welcome that deal with race, class, gender, sexual orientation, trans issues, mental health, physical health, disability, cultural respect, immigrant rights issues, or really any other cases of anyone vulnerable needing something from a group of less vulnerable people.
4. I am glad you are here. Whether you came here to submit a task or to work on one or both or neither, you are valuable and your participation and interest makes the world better. Just by reading this far, you made it a little better. That's amazing. Thank you so much.

Uh, ok?

What do I do now?

A: Go to the issue queue to look at the tasks. If you scroll back up to the top, it's probably in the sidebar on the right, where it says "issues".
